# python-challenge


Python-challenge homework comprised of two different challenge opportunities to advance the use of python for solving real world scenarios.


PyBank's program helps a business more easily make calculations and analysis of their profit and loss over a series of months and years. The total months and total profit over those total months is calculated as well as the average profit and loss changes over those periods. The months with the greatest profit/loss changes and the lowest profit/loss changes are shown.

PyPoll's program allows for a quick tabulation of the results of an election. The total votes cast and the votes received for each candidate and the percentage of the vote they received is easily retrieved over a large file. The winner is then shown.
